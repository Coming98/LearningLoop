_A personal repository to document my continuous learning in computer science, engineering, and artificial intelligence._

## 🧭 About

Welcome to my learning journal.

This is a living repository where I take notes, summarize concepts, explore new ideas, and document my journey through:

- 💻 Computer Science
- ⚙️ Computer Engineering
- 🧠 Artificial Intelligence
- 🛠️ Development (Web, Android, IOS)
- 🧪 TBD

I love taking notes while I'm learning, and I want to maintain this habit by managing this repository and my blog.

If any of this helps you — that makes the journey even more meaningful ✨.
